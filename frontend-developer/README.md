## HTML

## Element Inspector 
My best friend 


## Render Engines 
Parse files to window pixels

browser --> engine  
Chrome --> Blink 

The basic form to see this is think that they parse the file to elements. Those are DOM. 

## DOM:
HTML but in the Browser

1. Parse to objects 
2. Calculate the styles
3. Calculate dimentions
4. Paint the different boxes 
5. Take a picture a show the result

## HTML Anatomic 

```
<h1 class = "title"> Hello World </h1>
```

h1 --> Element
class = --> Attribute 
"title" --> Value 

## HTML Semantic 
Use elements, label with meaning

- Helps to be accesibility 
- Better position in internet/SEO
- Code more beautiful

div, not has means...but is necessary for times
